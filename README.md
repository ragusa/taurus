##Taurus is a C++ library for the efficient model order reduction of parametrized PDEs

`Taurus` offers a parallel implementation of the following algorithms:

- proper orthogonal decomposition
- discrete empirical interpolation method and its matrix variant
- Galerkin reduced basis methods
- mesh morphing by radial basis functions

`Taurus` is built upon the following libraries:

- Trilinos 
- LifeV
- HDF5
- Parmetis

`Taurus` was designed, developed and implemented at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) - [Chair of Modeling and Scientific Computing](http://cmcs.epfl.ch/)) by Dr. Davide Forti and Dr. Federico Negri. 

This repository contains a limited subset of applications addressed by the authors using Taurus. Here we provide a simple benchmark case described in [this manuscript (Sect. 6.1)](http://mathicse.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/mathicse/files/Mathicse%20reports%202016/21.2016_DB-AM-AQ.pdf).

Taurus depends on a particular version of the LifeV library. It can be obtained upon request at <tauruslibmor@gmail.com>.
